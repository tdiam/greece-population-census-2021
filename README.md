# Greece Population Census 2021 Data

2021 population numbers by administrative region (Περιφέρειες) and by municipality (Δήμοι) in Greece.

Sourced from Hellenic Statistical Authority's **provisional** data as announced in [this PDF](https://www.statistics.gr/documents/20181/17776954/NWS_Census_results_BOOKLET_19072022_GR.pdf/e819abde-a3ae-2418-bb5a-1c5365310e3e?t=1658222922216) (sigh).

NOTE: The census results are still provisional. As per the Authority (p. 61), logical and completeness checks are due, as well as cross-checks with national registries for quality control.
